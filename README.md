# Facts Database 3.0 / Broadbrush

My simple facts database, because our facts database has outgrown Google Sheets. This is a work in progress.

## Roadmap to 1.0
  * Get routes set up for Article and Author types
  * Set up filter / search features
  * Design it so it doesn't look like it ran out of 1996
  * Import existing data (CSV to JSON maybe?)

## Roadmap to 2.0
  * Add drag and drop or story creator functionality / being able to build narratives based on facts.
  * Add auto-citations or something that approximates it
